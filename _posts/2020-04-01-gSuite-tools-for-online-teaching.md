Google had a lot of tools like hangout on air and many others. But, many
because unavailable now. In this COVID19 season below tool see a surge.

- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) is one possibility
- [Skype](https://web.skype.com) Group call + Screen share
- [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) - An open-source
- [YouTube Live](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UC/livestreaming) - stream

Everything has its own advantages + disadvantages

- zoom can not record 40+ mins
- skype has can not call 50+ participants
- web skype needs no install
- skype mobile is available
- Jistsi also is in mobile


Google has a lot of resources

- Moodle  == [Classroom](https://classroom.google.com)
- Zoom == [Meet](https://meet.google.com/)
- CamStacia/CamStudio == [Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com)

and few others. More details here at [Teaching from home.](https://teachfromhome.google/intl/en/)
There is a nice presentation [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/teachfromhome.appspot.com/en-toolkit.pdf).

- Some of these tools are available only in Gsuite. Seems like temporary?
- Sometime later, will tell about all open/free tools.
