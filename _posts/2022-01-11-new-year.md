Happy new year 2022. Hopefully I will complete my PhD this year!

### New habits

- Started to read books. (Digital Minimalism, Stillness is the key,...)
- Starting to keep away from internet for some definite time per day.

### Big fan of

- TRID (and Sheena)'s [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf47F1IOmbg) and his (their) [funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dH3NPaLzGA), [wittly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYDC097mPPw) remarks.
- [Wordle game](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). Found what are those square blocks circulating on twitter. Solved it on Day 2.
- The Encanto -- Disney's latest animated movie! Love most charactors and song. Great to see animators capture visuals from choreographers and dancers.

### PhD Plan

- Finish DIMACS
- Finish seminar-2
- Finish 2nd work and submit
- Start 3rd work (bc?)
