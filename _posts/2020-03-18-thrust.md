For long time, I was under the impression that thrust functions can be
invoked only from the main function/Host device. Just got to know that thrust
(v1.8+) fucntion can be invocked inside the kernel

```cuda
__global__ void test(float *d_A, int N) {
    float sum = thrust::reduce(thrust::seq, d_A, d_A + N);
    printf("Device side result = %f\n", sum);
}
```
