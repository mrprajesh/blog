I happen to know this pretty late. Github is set the rename the master branch
as main branch. So, why does Github do so?

>After the brutal death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests earlier this year, tech companies wanted to show their support for the black community by abandoning non-inclusive terms such as master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist.

That's good.


From 01-Oct-2020, all new repos created will have default branch as `main`.
Github has provided [details](https://github.com/github/renaming) for older repos to migrate.
So, should be fairly easy for old repos. Let's see.

Cheers,
Bye
