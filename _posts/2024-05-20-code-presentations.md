To make :heart: presentations effective, especially, for me while showcasing the incremental code changes for a particular function..
It is a must to have the visually appealing (diff) animation. The answer is Morph Transitions. 
Sadly, it is present in only on windows. I am a Linux user for 10+ years.  Believe me, I have to install Windows inside my linux on VM. :S
Would love to see this option in Google Slides or Open office. Okay, enough of the build-up. 
Steps are in a DIY-style. 

Steps

1. Make the first slide
2. Duplicate
3. Make changes
4. Add morph to 2nd slide. with "words" as effect options. Reduce time to 1 second (for better viewing.)
5. Tada done. okay, tata!
