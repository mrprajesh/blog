This is post contains `latex` or `math` mode symbols.

$$A_1 \times B_2 = C_3$$


- As `mathjax.js` is loaded from the `default.html`,
- even for the post/page that was not using math/latex symbols it used load `mathjax.js`
unnecessarily.
- Have added [new variable](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/#custom-variables) called
`mathjax` to the front matter for posts.
- we can now load mathjax only for the post that has math symbols.
- We should remember to set variable to true for post having math symbols.

```
mathjax: true
```

#### _layouts/default.html

{% raw %}
    {% if page.mathjax == true %}
      {% include mathjax.html %}
    {% endif %}_
{% endraw %}
