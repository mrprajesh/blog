- Assuming this is an extension of my earlier [mathjax post](/blog/latex-jekyll.html)
- This post contains `latex` or `math` mode symbols.

$$A_1 \times B_2 = C_3$$

- `mathjax.js` is loaded from the `default.html`, even for the post/page
- that was not using math/latex symbols it used load `mathjax.js` unnecessarily.
- 23 HTTP page request vs 4 (with mathjax vs without)
- So, decided to load only for post having math symbols
- Have added [new variable](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/#custom-variables) called
`mathjax` to the front matter for posts.
- Now, we can now load mathjax only for the post that has math symbols.
- But, should remember to set variable to true for post having math symbols.
