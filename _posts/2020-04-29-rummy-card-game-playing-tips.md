Indian Rummy; 13 Cards Rummy or Points Rummy.

### Types

1. Rummy
2. Rummy with open joker

### Setup

- 13 x 4 + 2 jokers = 54 cards = 1 deck
- For 2 players  = 1 deck
- If 2-5 players  = 2 deck
- If 6+  player = 3 deck

### Gameplay


- Shuffle, dealing, start, circular turns, declare, and score!

- Dealing: to every player with 13; cut open card and game joker.
- Circular-turn: in a player's turn should pick and discard
- Declare: in a players turn after picking, closd a card and show melds
- Scoring: verify declaration and others points, and update score!

### Rules

Meld is 3+ cards of seq/run or set!
Note a set is 3 or 4!


### Strategy

Prioritize these first!

1. Aim for pure sequence/run (original rummy)
2. Aim for pure/impure sequence (or additional rummy or second run/seq)
3. Aim if sets (or dummy) or pure/impure sequence possible
4. Aim for 4th card
5. If someone declared, rearrange to minimize your score points


### OWN: Maximize your probability towards winning



### Minimize points

Assuming you have a pure run and second sequence

1. In a two impure sequence, keep joker to the largest sequence.
2. In a 4 card meld, try to reuse start/end card to make a set
3. In a 4+ card meld with stating/ending joker, reuse the joker to other melds
4. In a 3 card meld (for 3rd) break to make set if any


1. {2 :diamonds:, 3 :diamonds:,  :black_joker:} {9 :hearts:, 10 :hearts:} Point=18 :fast_forward::fast_forward: {2 :diamonds:, 3 :diamonds:} {9 :hearts:, 10 :hearts:, :black_joker:}  Points=5
