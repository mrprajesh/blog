Many at time one **life** take too many quick turns. Lately,
- Preethi's Pregnancy and other complications
- Father-in-law COVID+
- Parents COVID+
- All fine and back home
- Preethi delivers a boy baby -- Shiva :heart_eyes: :)

Hope all my priorities and roles(as son and husband) are over now. Time
to continue my role as PhD scholar with high priority.
Of course, new role father is added to it.


Cheers,

Rajz
