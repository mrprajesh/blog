Many at time one **life** take too many quick turns. Lately,
- Preethi Pregnant and other complications
- Father-in-law COVID+
- Parents COVID+
- All fine and back home
- Preethi delivers a boy baby -- Shiva :) :heart_eyes:

Hope all my priorities and roles(as sond and husband) are over now. Time
to continue my role as PhD scholar now. Of course new role father is
added to it.

Cheers,
Rajz
