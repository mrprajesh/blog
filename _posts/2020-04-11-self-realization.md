**TL;DR**

> Do not lie even once. It trains your mind to lie even when you do not what to.

> Instead of thinking reasons for not working, squeeze-in and get some more work done.

#### Blame me?

When a work (that I am supposed to complete) is delayed or not done
- I use to blame me, others, and many other things surrounding me
- I realized our mind searches/thinks for all possible reasons that (possibly)affected the work
- In fact, some could be true or to a extent it will
- Then, I realized instead of wasting time thinking
- We could use those time to get the work done!

### A = Lie;

Brain is a wonderful device
- You do some thing (A) just once or twice
- It gets trained so quickly
- tries to imitate those things (A) every time.

e.g You did not have breakfast that day since you woke up late.
Also, there is no time to have because you have important meeting with your professor in 20 mins.
After quick bath you rush to meeting. To your surprise, the prof ask me if I had breakfast.
So, you say yes (A). Yes, you do not want to say the whole story and occupy your meeting time.
(why? woke late; why? late to sleep; why? first day + night show movie of your fav actor that you can not miss out)

Later sometime, when the prof ask if I had finished the last week assignment. He says "yes" it is nearing completion.
The reality is I had not done enough work that week. :flushed:

**why?**
- researching coronavirus,
- tracking the #cases (wordwide, India, TN, Chennai, velachery,..., Italy, USA, Nigeria, ..),
- reading any paper on journal about corona virus that just published, trying find vaccine,
- panic buying veggies + groceries, batting mosquitoes at home.
- and writing this blog

I promise I will say the truth. No matter what!

#### Moral of the story

> Do not lie even once. It trains your mind to lie even when you do not what to.
> Work and do not spend (x) thinking reasons why you did not work.
> Instead, squeeze-in that time (x) to do some more useful work.

I used to self-evaluate me every day. Rupesh gave a valuable advice not do it that way.
But, instead perform over large period. More about this on a later post.
