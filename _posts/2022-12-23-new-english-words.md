### Some new terms that I got to know recently.

1. **Scambaiter** -- / noun. computing slang / The practice of pretending to fall for fraudulent online schemes in order to waste the time of the perpetrators.
[Some popular ones](https://www.about-fraud.com/2022/03/22/youtube-fraud-channels/). I am fan of Jim. 

2. **Declarative vs Imperative programming language**
   >**Declarative programming** is a paradigm describing WHAT the program does, without explicitly specifying its control flow. **Imperative programming** is a paradigm describing HOW the program should do something by explicitly specifying each instruction (or statement) step by step, which mutate the program's state
   >Eg. Dec: Haskell/Erlang. Imp: C/CPP/Java.
