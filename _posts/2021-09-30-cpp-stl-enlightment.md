C++ is moving so fast especially in the recent decade. I learned C++ without STL (in 2010's)
and only learned about STL containers much after 2014 (during my PG). There were
lot of useful data structure such a set, map, vector, etc.

STL isn't just about that. STL algorithms is a whole new world.
I saw this Corner's talk in CPPCON _Algorithm Intuition_ and has learned a lot.
This is a amazing talk!

I recommend one more. It is **Jonathan Boccara**'s talk on **105 STL Algorithms in Less Than an Hour**

If you are writing CUDA or thrust program's then I suggest one.

Basically, if we can solve problems with a the sequence of STL algorithms then that can be translated into CUDA/Thrust code easily using **device_vector**. But not problems exhibit this behaviour. But, the intuition to think and solve along those lines always help us with a better C++/Thrust code.


I am in :heart: with STL algorithms, recently.


There is new language called [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)). WHAT! Yes. I have spelled it right.
You can solve most of the competitive programming problems in just 1 or 2 lines. Watch more of his videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Njxgy4itts) OMG! :open_mouth:


Cheers, more later!
