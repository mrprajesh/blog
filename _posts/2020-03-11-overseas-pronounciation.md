So, we know homonyms. Same pronunciation but different spelling/meaning.

> e.g. right and write

But, this word **overseas** has same spelling but different meaning/pronunciation.


>adverb: overseas; /əʊvəˈsiːz/
>>in or to a foreign country, especially one across the sea.
>>"he spent quite a lot of time working overseas"


>adjective: overseas;  /ˈəʊvəsiːz/
>>from, to, or relating to a foreign country, especially one across the sea.
>>"overseas trips"


Is this also homonyms. Time to see its [definition](https://www.google.com/search?q=Homonyms).
It seems like. Are there more?
