There is angular js and node js -- java script based front-end web/GUI apps.
Similarly, on mobile we need separated development environment for Android and iOS.
Devs use Android studio and Apple's Software etc.But, then there were apps which does both but it is not very flexible as native tools.

There are some *new* technologies (at least to me) where you can create
web, desktop, mobile (andriod+ios) in a single development, open-source mobile application framework.

- [Flutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_(software))
- [React Native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_Native)
- [IONIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_(mobile_app_framework))

These kind of hybrid-development will surely save a "lot" of time.

Previously, I was introduced to [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)) framework which creates an universal GUI application irrespective of the operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac). It used HTML5 + Chromium engine.

Nice to see! world is changing so fast. I am rarely catching up these days.
