Instead of doing work (needs to be done!) Rajesh keeps tinkering.

### Bikeshed
Happen to see a few C++/HTML standards committee people using [Bikeshed]() for writing
drafts/proposal. Got to know from [Bryce](https://github.com/brycelelbach/wg21_p2145_evolving_cpp_remotely)
See how it [looks](https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/?force=1&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brycelelbach/wg21_p2145_evolving_cpp_remotely/master/evolving_cpp_remotely.bs). Just from bs file in git repo.
Cool. Isn't? May be we can use this for docs?

How to [bikeshed](/blog/how-to-bikeshed.html) or [bikeshed]({% link _posts/2020-03-30-how-to-bikeshed.md %})!

### HTML5

I had an impression that HTML5 is a version of HTML standard. But..

> the term "HTML5" is widely used as a buzzword to refer to
> **modern webtechnologies**, many of which (though by no means all) are
> developed at the [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/).

Quite surprised to read this [from](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#is-this-html5?) HTML standard.
BTW, I suspect this is generated using bikeshed!?

> The HTML Living Standard, which is developed by WHATWG, is the official version, while W3C HTML5 is no longer separate from WHATWG

Now `W3C == WHATWG` as said in [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#WHATWG_HTML_versus_HTML5)



### Markdown

Ever since daring-fireball/John-Gruber introduced mark down. It became so popular.
Everyone liked it because of its simplicity and usability. Even Reddit and GitHub rely on it!

There are other extensions of it.

- [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/)
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- Some more like Markdown Extra, Pandoc, ... // Read [WIKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
